# Build Fix Instructions

## Issue: Vercel Build Failed - Outdated Lockfile

### Error:

```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json
```

### Solution Applied:

1. **Updated pnpm lockfile locally**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Verified build works locally**:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

3. **Pushed changes to trigger new deployment**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Vercel Environment Settings

If the issue persists, check these Vercel settings:

1. **Build & Development Settings**:

   - Build Command: `pnpm build`
   - Install Command: `pnpm install`
   - Node.js Version: 20.x

2. **Environment Variables** (if needed):

   ```
   PNPM_VERSION=10
   NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS=true
   ```

3. **Root Directory**:
   - Should be `.` (root)

### Alternative Solutions:

If Vercel continues to have issues:

1. **Clear Vercel Build Cache**:

   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Project Settings → Functions
   - Clear build cache

2. **Force rebuild**:

   - Go to Deployments
   - Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
   - Check "Use existing build cache" = OFF

3. **Update Vercel CLI** (if using):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel@latest
   vercel --version
   ```

### Dependencies Status:

✅ All dependencies are properly installed
✅ Lockfile is synchronized with package.json
✅ Local build passes successfully
✅ Latest commit pushed to GitHub

The deployment should now work correctly.
